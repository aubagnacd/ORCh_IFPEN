# ORCh
ORCh (Optimised and Reduced Chemistry) is a fully automated method to reduce detailed chemical schemes.

The development of ORCh is reported in two archival papers (make sure to cite those papers when using this program):

ORCh has been applied to various reactive flow problems:

ORCh is a preprocessing tool designed to automatically generate and optimise reduced chemistry for specific CFD conditions, including fuel spray, heat losses, etc.

ORCh combines stochastic methods with graph-analysis together with genetic algorithms. Chemical kinetics are probed in laminar flames and turbulent micro-mixing (pairwise interaction or euclidean minimum spanning tree) canonical problems.

ORCh is coupled with HYPE (HYbrid stochastic sectional method for solving Population balance Equations) and machine learning to deal with carbon nanoparticles formation (nanotube and soot) and non-internal solid particles (crystallisation).

ORCh can include the training of ANN-CNN to reduce chemistry and pre-integrate stiff chemical systems or to solve for soot:
